# slitherio
[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/dunnousername/slitherio.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/dunnousername/slitherio)

Totally not related to that other game...
Just a quick project I put together. It only needs SDL2 and OpenGL headers to be built.

Build with:
```
c++ -DUSE_SDL2 -o slitherio slitherio.cpp -lSDL2 -lGL
```

Use the P key to pause, and the Q key to quit.
